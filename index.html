            <h3>An Informal Introduction to Python</h3>
            <p>In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (>>>
                and …): to repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines
                that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line
                by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command. <br>
                You can toggle the display of prompts and output by clicking on >>> in the upper-right corner of an
                example box. If you hide the prompts and output for an example, then you can easily copy and paste the
                input lines into your interpreter. <br>

                Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments.
                Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A
                comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string
                literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to
                clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.
            </p>
            <h4>Some examples:</h4>
                    <p id="example">
                        # this is the first comment <br>
                        spam = 1 # and this is the second comment <br>
                        # ... and now a third! <br>
                        text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."
                    </p>

            <p>
                Let’s try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and wait for the primary prompt, >>>. (It
                shouldn’t take long.)

            Numbers
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>>>> 2 + 2</li>
            <li>4</li> 
            <li>>>> 50 - 5*6</li>  
            <li>20 </li> 
            <li>>>> (50 - 5*6) / 4</li>
            <li>5.0</li> 
            <li>>>> 8 / 5 # division always returns a floating point number</li> 
            <li>1.6</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type
            float. We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial. <br>

            Division (/) always returns a float. To do floor division and get an integer result (discarding any
            fractional result) you can use the // operator; to calculate the remainder you can use %:
        </p>
        <p>
            >>> 17 / 3 # classic division returns a float <br>
            5.666666666666667 <br>
            >>> <br>
            >>> 17 // 3 # floor division discards the fractional part
            5 <br>
            >>> 17 % 3 # the % operator returns the remainder of the division <br>
            2 <br>
            >>> 5 * 3 + 2 # floored quotient * divisor + remainder <br>
            17 <br>

            <p>
                Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be
                enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result 2. \ can be used to
                escape quotes:
            </p>
            <p>
                >>> 'spam eggs' # single quotes <br>
                'spam eggs' <br>
                >>> 'doesn\'t' # use \' to escape the single quote... <br>
                "doesn't" <br>
                >>> "doesn't" # ...or use double quotes instead <br>
                "doesn't" <br>
                >>> '"Yes," they said.' <br>
                '"Yes," they said.' <br>
                >>> "\"Yes,\" they said." <br>
                '"Yes," they said.' <br>
                >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.' <br>
                '"Isn\'t," they said.' <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the interactive interpreter, the output string is enclosed in quotes and special characters are
                escaped with backslashes. While this might sometimes look different from the input (the enclosing quotes
                could change), the two strings are equivalent. The string is enclosed in double quotes if the string
                contains a single quote and no double quotes, otherwise it is enclosed in single quotes. The print()
                function produces a more readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped and
                special characters:

            Lists
            </h4>
            <p>
                Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is
                the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets.
                Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.
            </p>
            <p>
                >>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] <br>
                >>> squares <br>
                [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] <br>

                <p>
                    Of course, we can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two and two together. For
                    instance,
                    we can write an initial sub-sequence of the Fibonacci series as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    >>> # Fibonacci series: <br>
                    ... # the sum of two elements defines the next <br>
                    ... a, b = 0, 1 <br>
                    >>> while a < 10: ... print(a) ... a, b=b, a+b ... 0 <br> 1 <br> 1 <br> 2 <br> 3 <br> 5 <br> 8 </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="for_Statements">
                <h4>
                    for Statements
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than
                    always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the
                    ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement
                    iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the
                    sequence. For example (no pun intended):
                </p>
                <p>
                    >>> # Measure some strings: <br>
                    ... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate'] <br>
                    >>> for w in words: <br>
                    ... print(w, len(w)) <br>
                    ... <br>
                    cat 3 <br>
                    window 6 <br>
                    defenestrate 12 br

                <p>
                    If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function range() comes in handy.
                    It generates arithmetic progressions:
                </p>
                <p>
                    >>> for i in range(5): <br>
                    ... print(i) <br>
                    ... <br>

                    break and continue Statements, and else Clauses on Loops

                <p>
                    The break statement, like in C, breaks out of the innermost enclosing for or while loop. <br>

                    Loop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion
                    of the iterable (with for) or when the condition becomes false (with while), but not when the loop
                    is terminated by a break statement. This is exemplified by the following loop, which searches for
                    prime numbers:
                </p>
                <p>
                    >>> for n in range(2, 10): <br>
                    ...     for x in range(2, n): <br>
                    ...         if n % x == 0: <br>
                    ...             print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x) <br>
                    ...             break <br>
                    ...     else: <br>
                    ...         # loop fell through without finding a factor <br>
                    ...         print(n, 'is a prime number') <br>
